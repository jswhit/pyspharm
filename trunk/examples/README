shallow_test.py tests using spharm to integrate a shallow water model.

regrid_test.py tests regrid and spectral interpolation functions.

geodesic.py and spharmonic.py use matplotlib (http://matplotlib.sf.net).

geodesic.py plots the locations on a sphere
corresponding to a twenty-sided (icosahedral) geodesic with
a given number of points on the side of each geodesic triangle.

spharmonic.py plots a spherical harmonic with a given order and degree.
